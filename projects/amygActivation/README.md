# amygActivation

- this task was based on the task structure described in Young et al. (2014)
- we're using blocks of rest, happy, math each 42 seconds long
- happy blocks: continuous feedback to upregulate amygdala activity
- math blocks: even/odd judgment
- rest blocks: fixation
- no feedback condition - same happy task but no feedback 
- there are 13 blocks of 42 seconds each
- 10 TRs are added after the first trigger and then 5 TRs are added at the end --> 379 TRs total
