sample.py (Last Updated: 01/16/2020)

The purpose of this script is to actually to run the sample project. 
Specifically, it will initiate a file watcher that searches for incoming dicom 
files, do some sort of analysis based on the dicom file that's been received, 
and then output the answer.

The purpose of this *particular* script is to demonstrated how you can use the 
various scripts, functions, etc. we have developed for your use! The functions
we will reference live in 'rt-cloud/rtCommon/'.

Finally, this script is called from 'projectMain.py', which is called from 
'run-projectInterface.sh'.
