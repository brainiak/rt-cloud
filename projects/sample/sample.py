sample.py (Last Updated: 01/26/2021)

The purpose of this script is to actually to run the sample project.
Specifically, it will initiate a call to file watcher that searches for incoming
dicom files, do some sort of analysis based on the dicom file that's been received,
and then output the answer.

The purpose of this *particular* script is to demonstrated how you can use the
various scripts, functions, etc. we have developed for your use! The functions
we will reference are in 'rt-cloud/rtCommon/'.

Finally, this script is called from the projectInterface which has a web interface
and accepts commands to 'start' or 'stop' a run. When the 'start' button is 
pressed it will run this scirpt passing in whatever conifgurations have been
set in the web page as a configuration file. Note that projectInterface is
started from the script 'run-projectInterface.sh'.
