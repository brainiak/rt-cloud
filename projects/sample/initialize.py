initialize.py (Last Updated: 01/16/2020)

The purpose of this script is to initialize the rt-cloud session. Specifically,
it will initiate any variables that need to be initiated (e.g., configuration
file) and upload any necessary files to the cloud.

    needed for registration) from the local (non-cloud) stimulus computer to the 
    cloud directory. Here, everything will be on the same computer but in different 
    folders to show how this will happen when you run your own experiment!
