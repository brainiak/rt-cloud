initialize.py (Last Updated: 01/16/2020)

The purpose of this script is to initialize the rt-cloud session. Specifically,
it will initiate any variables that need to be initiated (e.g., configuration
file) and upload any necessary files to the cloud.

    use during your real-time experiment or a registration file that is integral
    for the analysis of your task. The point of this script is to upload files
    to the cloud that you will need for your entire scanning session.

    In this demo, we will show how you can move files (e.g., such as those 
    needed for registration) from the local (non-cloud) console computer to the 
    cloud directory. Here, everything will be on the same computer but in different 
    folders to show how this will happen when you run your own experiment!
