initialize.py (Last Updated: 01/16/2020)

The purpose of this script is to finalize the rt-cloud session. Specifically,
here we want to dowload any important files from the cloud back to the console
computer and maybe even delete files from the cloud that we don't want to 
stay there (maybe for privacy purposes).
