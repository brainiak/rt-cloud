"""
SubjectInterface is a client interface (i.e. for the experiment script running in the cloud)
that facilitates interaction with the subject in the MRI scanner, such as sending
classification results to drive the subject display, or receiving their responses (e.g. button-box).

To support RPC calls from the client, there will be two instances of SubjectInterface, one
at the cloud projectServer which is a stub to forward requests (started with subjectRemote=True),
and another at the presentation computer, run as a service and with subjectRemote=False.

The subjectInterface instance can also be instantiated within the projectServer if the
projectServer and presentation computer run on the same system.
