"""
BidsInterface is a client interface (i.e. for the experiment script running in the cloud) that
provides data access to BIDS data.

To support RPC calls from the client, there will be two instances of dataInterface, one
at the cloud projectServer which is a stub to forward requests (started with dataRemote=True),
and another at the control room computer, run as a service and with dataRemote=False.

When not using RPC, i.e. when the projectServer is run without --dataRemote, there will be only
one instance of dataInterface, as part of the projectServer with dataRemote=False.
