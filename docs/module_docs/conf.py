# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# Set the directories for AutoAPI to find source code
# AutoAPI's has two advantages over sphinx-apidoc:
# 1) AutoAPI runs automatically whenever sphinx-build runs, so there's no
# separate, manual step to generate RST files.
# 2) AutoAPI uses code parsing instead of code imports, which means there's no
# need to install the full RT-Cloud conda environment (takes >10m on RTD).

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
