    "## Understanding BIDS Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "BIDS Entities, referred to later as just 'entities', are used to create the file names of files in a BIDS Archive and describe the file they name. You may already be familiar with common ones, like `subject`, `task`, and `run`. An example of a file name containing BIDS Entities is `sub-01_task-languageproduction_run-01_bold.nii.gz`, which contains the `subject`, `task`, and `run` entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most entities are used in a key-value form (`key-value`, e.g., `sub-01`) and have their name and value present wherever they are used. They have three main representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Entity**: One word, all lowercase. A summary of the entity. (e.g., 'ceagent', 'subject')\n",
    "2. **Full Name**: Up to several words, fully describes the entity. (e.g., 'Contrast Enhancing Agent', 'Subject')\n",
    "3. **File Name Key**: A few characters, used in file names. (e.g., 'ce', 'sub')\n",
    "\n",
    "A few entities and their multiple representations are shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Entity | Full Name | File Name Key |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| ceagent | Contrast Enhancing Agent | ce |\n",
    "| subject | Subject | sub |\n",
    "| session | Session | ses |\n",
    "| run | Run | run |\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this writing, the other valid entities for BIDS and BIDS Derivatives are listed in the BIDS Standard and in JSON files in the PyBids Github repository (https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids/tree/master/bids/layout/config). An easy way to view all valid entities in RT-Cloud, which are loaded from PyBids, is to view the dictionary returned by the following:"

    "# BIDS Archive: Getting & Appending Incrementals\n",

    "One of the most important functions that a BIDS Archive enables in the context of RT-Cloud is working with `BIDS Incrementals`. From a `BIDS Archive`, you can get image data and metadata and package it into a `BIDS Incremental` using `getIncremental`. The opposite operation, for when you already have a `BIDS Incremental` and want to either append it to an existing archive (or create a new archive), is to append it to a `BIDS Archive` using `appendIncremental`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a complete dataset that you want to test a new real-time experiment on, you can using `getIncremental` repeatedly to iterate over your entire dataset, streaming the resulting BIDS Incrementals to RT-Cloud and the new experimental script you want to try out. Then, when you're running your new experiment in RT-Cloud for real, as `BIDS Incremental` files are streamed from the scanner to your script, you can create a new `BIDS Archive` in an empty folder on the computer running your script, and build up the archive of your entire experiment by calling `appendIncremental` for each `BIDS Incremental` you receive.
